# Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions in a real world dataset containing credit card transactions. The dataset contains information about 97,000 transactions, such as transaction date, card number, merchant state, zip and ID etc and a label for each transaction denoting if it is fraudulent or not. We want to design a model in a supervised way to detect/predict fraud on new incoming transactions. 
## Approach
Since our focus is on credit card purhcases, we removed any transcations that were marked otherwise (such as card activation, refund etc.).
### Data Preprocessing
After inspecting the dataset, we noticed that more than 8,000 values were missing 
### Feature Engineering
